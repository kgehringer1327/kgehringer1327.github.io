				<h3> <u>Favorite Activity </u></h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-variant: small-caps;">
				Whenever anyone asks my favorite place that I have ever traveled I immediately respond with Croatia. When I went to Croatia, I felt so at peace and I have never felt so relaxed. I like to refer to one of the days I had here as the best day of my life. My parents planned a day boat trip for us where we went to 3 separate islands. We stopped at each for about 2 hours and just swam and snorkeled and I would do anything to go back to that day. My favorite spot we snorkeled at was the Blue Cave.

				<h3><u> Favorite Airbnb </u></h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 100%; font-variant: small-caps;">
			I been fortunate to do a good amount of traveling so I have stayed in many different hotels, Airbnb's apartments, etc. but my favorite of all time was the Airbnb we stayed in in Paris. I found this Airbnb for my family - maybe that’s why I like it so much :). But real talk, it was sitting on the quad facing the Eiffel Tower so from our Airbnb you felt like you were standing right next to the Eiffel Tower. We would watch the lights go off on the Eiffel Tower every night from our balcony and my family still talks about this place.

				<h3><u>Favorite Place </u></h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 100%; font-variant: small-caps;">
			I am 25% Danish, and still have some relatives that live in Denmark. Seeing our family that lives in Denmark, made this trip so different because we got the real experience. My favorite place we visited was Tivoli Gardens. Tivoli Gardens was like a high end six flags - it’s an amusement park but has gardens too. They sometimes have live music and when I was there Shawn Mendes was playing so it is an experience I will never forget! It’s gorgeous and I cannot believe they made an amusement park that nice!
