				<h3><u>Favorite Experience</u></h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-variant: small-caps;">
			There are not many times you can say you hiked part of an active volcano that just recently erupted in 2010, but Costa Rica was full of surprises and that was that something my family got to do. One of the coolest things we did in Arenal was a ropes course near the bottom of the volcano. It was one of the coolest experiences, because the whole time you are trying to keep moving through this course but staring at the gorgeous volcano. There was also many monkeys and other cool wildlife all throughout!

				<h3> <u>Favorite Hotel </u> </h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-variant: small-caps;">
			Throughout many different types of hotels stays ranging from being in a city, to a ski town, to on the beach, my family will always rave about Punta Islita. After we arrived in Costa Rica, we had one of the most absurd drives to the hotel and our driver explained to us that if it wasn't dry season the car would be underwater at some point?!  When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with the best service, and the most beautiful resort. Bonus, there were monkeys everywhere! I want to go back ASAP!

				<h3><u> Favorite Excursion </u> </h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 100%; font-variant: small-caps;">
		
	When my family was in Mexico, we stayed at a resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico and stayed there a majority of the time, but one of the days we decided to escape and headed to Tulum where we visited ruins of an ancient Mayan port city, and got to snorkel and in some of the most gorgeous water. I am not a history person at all but even I thought the ruins were cool and I had a great time exploring here. As for the snorkeling, the water was such a vibrant blue and saw some of the coolest fish!
